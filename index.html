    <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
 <h3 class="margin">Phase 1 Course Goals</h3>
        <br>
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p>My projects helped foster creative habits of the mind by encouraging me to learn something new. Not only did I learn a skill entirely new to me — how to create a web file through coding — but I was also encouraged to experiment with different modes of creation. I used examples given to us by both the professor and peers to consider what skills I wanted to learn in order to create something unique, playing around with different formatting techniques involving various fonts, colors, and animations. I formed an image in my mind of what I wanted my projects to look like, then learned coding skills both in and out of class to bring these concepts to life. I've learned first-hand that coding can be a creative outlet through which one can express personal ideas, passions, and experimentation. At first, I was somewhat frustrated with our assignments, for I struggled to learn the process of coding and adapt to the languages of HTML and CSS. By our third project, however, I found myself researching more ways to branch off the provided formats because I was having fun devising new ways to make my sites unique, enjoying the satisfaction of creating something new that had seemed, prior to this class, beyond my capabilities.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></p>
  <p>In any academic and professional setting, engaging with others in a workshop environment is a crucial and useful skill. In this class, specifically, our workshops created multiple opportunities for engaged pedagogy and shared growth. By presenting my projects to both my professor and peers, I got an idea of how my work was perceived as well as how I felt when other people viewed it. I learned when I did, and didn't, feel satisfied with my work by allowing the judgement of others, from which I was given useful feedback that helped guide me in new directions. In addition, watching others present their work gave me further insight into the realm of coding. By viewing the creative work of my peers, I gained new ideas of how to play around with code and turn my projects into something unique. I would notice a certain aspect of another's project, maybe a colored background or an animated text, and was thus encouraged to challenge myself the way my peers had challenged themselves, to work away from the simple formats towards something more difficult, yet far more satisfying.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft </em></p>
  <p>After completing only three assignments, this course has taught me an entirely new craft: how to create a website through coding. At first, I simply wanted to complete our assignments as efficiently as possible and then move on with other tasks, projects, and activities. Soon, however, I found myself honing in on these assignments for the sake of learning the craft itself — that is, learning how to code. In class, watching my peers present their own work, I considered the complexity of coding and the vast opportunities open to us through the practice of coding. I'll admit, I envied some of my peers for the ease with which they'd mastered the craft, and was inspired to use them and their work as examples to go off of. I was fascinated by the idea that a complex site, with various moving parts and a seamless layout and layered images, could be created so (seemingly) easily by a student just like me. Our course has enabled me to create something new and unique that I can call my own. There is something both challenging and rewarding in creating a web file through code, and I am excited to continue doing so as I expand my knowledge on coding throughout this course and in later, personal projects.</p>

       <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development</em></p>
  <p>At the start of this course, I saw coding as an alien subject, some mystical skill that seemed out of my reach. I soon learned that the skills and techniques necessary to create a unique website were very accessible, I just needed to take the time and energy to learn them. I was able to learn the basics by following the instructions outlined in the code of the first assignment. By the second and third, however, I was expanding on this knowledge through additional research. In order to improve my skills, I set up a zoom session with <a href="https://davidholcer.github.io/" target="_blank">a friend who tutors in coding</a> who walked me through both HTML and CSS, helping to improve my understanding of the code languages while also encouraging me to engage in personal research, showing me how I could find infinite examples of text fonts, animations, and buttons online to mimic and insert into my own code. With this newfound knowledge that I could, literally, teach myself to code, I engaged in sustained research that went beyond the minimum requirements in order to expand and improve my skills. By way of illustration, I was revising our New Media Webtext Experiment in Hillman earlier this week with the intention of fixing up some minor issues and improving my formatting. Soon, however, I realized that I'd finished these small tasks to spend several hours watching videos explaining the ins-and-outs of CSS, reviewing a variety of animated fonts — which I had tried, and failed, to insert within my own work — and experimenting with animated texts. Our projects have not merely engaged my mind by completing the assignments, but also by encouraging me to expand on these assignments for the sake of learning more, adding additional skills to my personal toolbox.</p>

  <div class="container-fluid bg-w text-center">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p>Growing up, I was always the student who never spoke, who struggled to participate outwardly in class conversations, and who felt like throwing up every time I had to give a presentation. Throughout my time in college, I have vastly improved my public speaking skills, but am still very nervous to present my work to my peers. Thus far, this course has helped me share my work without fear of judgement from my peers. While I've felt, at times, as if my projects did not come close in creativity or complexity to those of my peers, our in-class presentations have provided me with a number of beneficial skills. They have helped me prepare myself to present before class both literally and mentally, have challenged me to consider when I am and am not proud of my work and why, and have improved my ability to maintain confidence while sharing my work. While presenting is scary, especially within an area of academia with which you have little knowledge, this class has helped ease this fear through mutual understanding that we are all learning, experimenting, and unsure of what we are really supposed to be doing — even those who seem so self-assured. As a result, I have, without a doubt, improved upon my ability to present in an academic setting.</p>

       <div class="container-fluid bg-b text-center">
     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2 and 3 Course Goals</h3>
<br>
  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>In our second and third units, my projects helped to foster creative habits of the mind by encouraging me to experiment with various modes of digital creation in Adobe Software Programs. With each assignment, I was tasked with generating some creative mode of digital expression, from an expository documentary to an animated gif, and offered a variety of methods to choose from or be inspired by. In each of these projects, I took the time and space to use the offered examples to brainstorm a unique, personalized idea and brought that idea to life by experimenting with different techniques, tools, and methods offered both in and outside of class. While some of my assignments have been building up to my final multimedia project, others have been completed in ways of personal significance, or simply for fun. When creating my B-Roll, Special Effect Sequence, and Character Animator, I considered how I could use each assignment to create something both enjoyable and entertaining. When creating my B-Roll, I devised a central theme that I am passionate about and brainstormed how to capture my footage in a way that could tell a story in an engaging manner. I used this as an opportunity to generate video sequences from various angles and speeds, considering how different techniques and methods could add to my purpose while also satisfying my creative drive, or simply my desire to experiment with b-roll footage. All of our projects involve taking an idea and bringing it to life through some creative means, deciding first what you want to communicate and then deciding how you can communicate this in a way that is both unique and engaging, using the available resources to create and edit until generating a final project that matches your idea. This is something that I demonstrate throughout the projects I offer in this unit.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>Throughout these two units, we have used our projects and methods of sharing to establish a tight-knit workshop environment that prioritizes interpersonal growth, where we expand our learning and grow our skillsets together, as peers. This entails listening to each other’s ideas, viewing and commenting on each other’s projects, and understanding that while we all have different background knowledge on class subjects, each of us still has something to offer. While I know that I, myself, am often engaged in a tough learning process with lots of trial and error as I navigate unfamiliar software, our workshops help me understand that my peers are in similar places. Despite some of their seemingly perfect products, I understand from our discussions how my more advanced peers are still learning just as I am. In other words, our workshops help me feel less alienated and lost. While it often feels as though I am far behind my peers, our discussions remind me that this is not necessarily the case. Similarly, I feel that my own struggles have given my peers a similar comfort. Through mutual understanding and attentive feedback, we bounce ideas off each other, communicate issues we have run into and suggest ways to get around them, and discover new ways of interacting with each assignment. I'll often notice and admire an aspect of a peer’s project and thus be inspired to do something similar, taking both the concerns and ideas of others to assist myself in my own creative process, and I feel confident that I offer the same to my peers. In addition, as we move into our final multimedia project, our weekly discussions regarding our project topic and current research have also illustrated where everyone is at in their process and how I can learn from, as well as help, my peers by sharing our project plans.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>Our focus on Adobe Software Applications has encouraged me to learn and perfect (to the best of my ability) an entirely new area of digital composition. While I have gained foundational knowledge, skills, and practices in our various project areas, I have also gained insight on how to use digital media to convey a certain message. Using many of our assignments to build towards my final project, I have brainstormed various ways to get my points across regarding food consumption in relation to factory farming. Not only did I learn how to use several Adobe applications and their accompanying tools, I also learned how to use these applications and tools to my advantage. Thinking deeply about craft doesn’t just mean developing a certain skillset, but also learning how to use this skillset to accomplish your goals, which I have done in building my work towards the completion of my final project. In addition, I found myself focusing on the more nuanced details of my projects rather than settling for mere completion. The Interview, especially, exemplifies my commitment to thinking deeply about craft as I repeatedly visited local stores to gather footage and interviews because I was not satisfied with my original work. I had an image in my mind of what I wanted my project to look like, and so I maintained the development of my work despite certain difficulties. Although I was not able to collect the footage I desired in the way that I desired, I thought deeply about how I could use what I already had to accomplish my purpose. I re-worked my footage in ways that made sense to me, increasing the scale of my clips and breaking them up into divided sections with clear prompts, so I could still generate the final product I had wanted to see.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p>Prior to this course, I had never used almost any Adobe application. I struggled for a while to learn the ins-and-outs of each platform, relying on in-class instruction, provided resources, and personally-researched resources to do so. I first strived to learn how to use each application in the simplest of ways to complete each respective assignment, gaining introductory knowledge in a variety of Adobe Software. As I moved on to later assignments and completed more work within each Adobe application, I familiarized myself with all essential tools and skills. Soon, I realized that things were coming easily to me that had not before, for I was gaining a more foundational understanding of how to use these applications to my advantage. Using the knowledge gained from my original drafts as a starting point, I used my final drafts to expand upon certain skills, engaging in sustained research through additional videos and tutorials so that I could incorporate feedback from class, ideas from group discussions, and simply improve my ability to use these tools. For example, I inserted Adobe special effects into each of my three video pieces (the Photo Essay, the B-Roll, and The Interview). I used The Interview, in particular, to build on nearly all skills learned throughout both units. I considered the presentation of each text item and video clip, how I illustrated my interview responses, the rhetoric of my questions, the organization of the documentary, and the function of b-roll footage to create an overarching narrative about our food system. I conducted research in each of these areas to determine how best to use these skills to give my project a more professional feel, adding b-roll footage, special effects, and image editing to my original project. As a result of my ongoing research and skill development, I was able to generate an engaging exploration into factory farming and our food system in order to make a point about how and why we purchase our groceries.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>A crucial aspect of this course is learning how to present our work. Throughout these past two units, our in-class workshops have encouraged me to develop my presentation skills on a regular basis. I’ve prepared myself and my work for presentation weekly, practiced packaging and presenting my work in an accessible and succinct manner, and learned the value of formally sharing one’s work. Presenting my work to my instructor and peers hasn’t simply improved my preparedness and public speaking skills, but also my ability to receive and interpret criticism from peers. When I share my work, I can appreciate the feedback I receive from others, as well as the feedback I receive from myself in terms of how I feel after sharing my work. Presenting enables me to assess whether I am confident in sharing my work, meaning I feel satisfied with my project, or whether I am more insecure in sharing my work, meaning I am not satisfied with my project. Similarly, by presenting my work to others on a regular basis, I can see how well my message comes across, thus telling me how successful my work is in generating an impact on a wide audience and how successful my presentation skills are within themselves. Furthermore, I’ve always struggled with public speaking and fear of judgement from others, and this class has definitely helped me overcome some of these anxieties. Given how often we present our work combined with our mutual understanding that everything is a work in progress, I’ve felt supported by a trusted audience and thus better able to present my work than in any class setting prior. Thus, I’ve been able to develop my presentation skills in a way I haven’t before.</p>
